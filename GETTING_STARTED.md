This guide will help you set up and start working with the ESP Keyboard Mimic project, even if you're new to programming or hardware development.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Visual Studio Code from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Have an ESP32 development board ready
3. Have a USB cable to connect your ESP32 to your computer

## First Time Setup

   - File -> Open Workspace from File...
   - Select the `esp-keyboard-mimic.code-workspace` file
   - Click "Yes, I trust the authors" when prompted

4. Wait for automatic setup:
   - VS Code will install recommended extensions
